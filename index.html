    <p>Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father,
      and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the
      University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17 to avoid
      conscription. He was enrolled at Queen's University and transferred to
      the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a
      bachelor's degree in economics and physics. He moved to California in
      1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a
      business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his
      brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million
      in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online bank X.com, which merged
      with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought by eBay
      in 2002 for $1.5 billion.</p>
